                    <em>Crossword puzzles</em>
                    From glasshouses I throw stones at <a href="">Goliaths</a>
                    Tryna break in my house, I killed pigs, wolves & lions
                    The reincarnation of King David, I ain't lyin'
                    How could I keep it plain and not fly in
                    with the intent to offset demands with numerous supplies
                    I came to fight, I prepared for rumours and retries,
                    lyrical etiquette, humorous replies
                    Tryna show the world my future even if they got tumours in they eyes
                    Raise the bar, once I've raised the veil
                    Resurrected a king, I wasn't raised to fail
                    The king reigned, till the people called for hail
                    War room getting jacked, Jill with the pail
                    Physical/Earthly stats couldn't determine my outcome
                    How come, I was chosen not to be outdone
                    Couldn't denounce the ounce of knowledge announced
                    So if the black boy fly don't mistake him for falcon
