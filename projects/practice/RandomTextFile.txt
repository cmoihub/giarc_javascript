Tryna break in my house, I killed pigs, wolves & lions
The reincarnation of King David, I ain't lyin'
How could I keep it plain and not fly in
with the intent to offset demands with numerous supplies
I came to fight, I prepared for rumours and retries,
lyrical etiquette, humorous replies
Tryna show the world my future even if they got tumours in they eyes
Raise the bar, once I've raised the veil
Resurrected a king, I wasn't raised to fail
The king reigned, till the people called for hail
War room getting jacked, Jill with the pail
Physical/Earthly stats couldn't determine my outcome
How come, I was chosen not to be outdone
Couldn't denounce the ounce of knowledge announced
So if the black boy fly don't mistake him for falcon
